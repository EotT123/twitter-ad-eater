# Twitter Ad Eater

Twitter Ad Eater is a module for the Xposed/[LSPosed](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed) framework that attempts to remove ads from the Twitter Android applicatoin.

I created this module after switching to Android 11 where [the original module](https://github.com/gusarov/TwitterAdKiller) [does not seem to work anymore](https://github.com/gusarov/TwitterAdKiller/issues/2).

The module is tested so far only on Android 11 and with the LSPosed framework. Feel free to [report any issues](https://github.com/ppawel/twitter-ad-eater/issues) and I will take a look.
